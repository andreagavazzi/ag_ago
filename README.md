# Background

Ago is my version of Leo Rover, the Unmannehd Ground Vehicle by Fictionlab. Ago is intended to be my hardware platform for future software projects in autonomous operations and IA development.

All information for building Ago is free and open source for anyone to build their own.

* Dimensions: 447x433x249 mm
* Payload capacity: ca. 5 kg
* Motorization: 4 x in-hub DC motor with 73.2:1 planetary gearbox and 12 CPR encoder
* Max. linear speed: ca. 0.4 m/s
* Max. angular speed: ca. 60 deg/s
* Run time: About 4 hrs
* Connection range: Up to 100m (with live video stream)

# Development Status and Milestones

**Ago version 1.0** 

- [ ] This milestone includes a basic rolling chassis that is mechanically functional
- [ ] Aestetic add-ons on the chassis (reactor, attachments and linkages, ...)
- [ ] Camera turret (webcam to be defined)
- [ ] Lidar laser scanner

# Sensors and Electronics

Ago will be equipped with an increasing number of sensors while the electronic is depending on the platform version. 
 
* Version 1.0: RaspberryPi 4B :arrow_left:
* Version 1.5: nVidia Jetson Nano 
* Version 2.0: nVidia Xavier AGX

# ROS and Artificial Intelligence

Ago is a [ROS](http://ros.org) robotics platform running on Linux Ubuntu, step by step I'll migrate some applications I built under my agRobotics firm.

**ROS Melodic**: ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license. ROS Melodic Morenia is the twelfth ROS distribution release.

**NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier**: The latest addition to the Jetson platform. Itâ€™s an AI computer for autonomous machines, delivering the performance of a GPU workstation in an embedded module under 30W. Jetson AGX Xavier is designed for robots, drones and other autonomous machines.
