# Background

Ago is my version of [Leo Rover](https://www.leorover.tech/), an Unmannehd Ground Vehicle by Fictionlab. Ago is intended to be my hardware platform for future software projects in autonomous operations and IA development.

All information for building Ago is free and open source for anyone to build their own.

**Ago version 1.0** 

- [ ] This milestone includes a basic rolling chassis that is mechanically functional
- [ ] Aestetic add-ons on the chassis (reactor, attachments and linkages, ...)
- [ ] Camera turret (webcamto be defined)

Ago is a [ROS](http://ros.org) robotics platform running on Linux Ubuntu.

**ROS Melodic**: [a ground-up rewrite of a ROS-centric stack](https://github.com/srmainwaring/curio) by Rhys Mainwaring (srmainwaring) is extensive and powerful. Going beyond responding to `/cmd_vel` commands, it also calculates `/odom` by interpolating the AX-18A position encoder ~270 degree feedback into full 360 degrees. Plus visualizing rover state in RViz, and files to put a digital Perseverance in Gazebo robot simulation environment.

**NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier**: The latest addition to the Jetson platform. Itâ€™s an AI computer for autonomous machines, delivering the performance of a GPU workstation in an embedded module under 30W. Jetson AGX Xavier is designed for robots, drones and other autonomous machines.
