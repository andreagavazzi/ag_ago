# Background

Perseverance is my version of a motorized model of Mars rovers Perseverance. It faithfully reproduces
the [Rocker-Bogie suspension kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker-bogie) of real
rovers and it is intended to be an hardware platform for future software projects in autonomous
operations and IA development.

All information for building Perseverance is free and public open source for anyone to build their
own.

The project was somehow inspired by [JPL's Open Source Rover project](https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov) and from the many resources I could find on the web. Unfortunately I did not fully like the design, too far from the original, so I decided to model one by myself. I used [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com) on my iPad pro, great piece of software still growing.
Most of the differences were motivated by a desire to fit the project to my requirements (mainly research in IA and autonomous navigation). Fitting Dynamixel servos was quite a challange and there is still room for improvements.

* Motorization: Moving the wheels is done with serial bus servo motors. I went for Dynamixel AX-18A I took from a previous hexapod project. 
* Construction Method: Instead of using the [Actobotics construction system](https://www.servocity.com/actobotics), Perseverance will be built from aluminum extrusions connected by 3D-printed plastic parts.
